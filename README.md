**II - How it Works ⚙️**

1) Upload a video using Google Colab
2) Frames are processed in real-time
3) If movement is detected → a green rectangle is drawn
4) If a face is detected within that zone → a blue rectangle appears
5) An email is automatically sent with a screenshot attached
6) The system waits 60 seconds before sending another alert (to avoid flooding your inbox)
